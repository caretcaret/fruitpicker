fruitpicker
=======

fruitpicker is a tool to help you create graphs from textual content and visualize connections between data from the content.

1. Copy and paste content into the left box.
2. Select some content and click the vertex button to make a new vertex. This sets the title of the vertex to your selection.
3. Select some more content and click the [+] button to insert subtitles or attributes to these vertices.
4. Unhappy with your selection? Select other text and click the corresponding title or attribute to replace it.
5. Repeat!

How to get started:

1. `git clone https://github.com/jczhang/fruitpicker.git`
2. For now, just visit `prototype/index.html`.
